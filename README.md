# FlutterRecipes

This project demonstrates a robust Flutter application, built with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, focusing on clean and scalable design.

## Features
- **MVVM Pattern**: Organized the codebase using the MVVM architecture to separate UI, business logic, and data handling layers.
- **API Handling**: Implemented a network calling mechanism with a base layer to handle success and failure responses gracefully.
- **State Management**: Managed application state using `ChangeNotifier` for a reactive and efficient UI.
- **Repository Pattern**: Decoupled data sources with a repository pattern to decide whether to fetch data from the server or local database.
- **Databases**: Utilized `sqflite` for local data storage and management.
- **Navigation**: Centralized navigation logic for seamless routing across the application.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this project as a reference for building Flutter applications with clean architecture and scalable features!
